## Hey there! 👋

 - I'm Minh, a backend-focused software developer.

 - I build backend systems that are reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain.

 - If a problem looks complex, I enjoy breaking it down and designing a clean solution for it.

 - My main tech stack is Java, Javascripts, Python, Spring Boot, NestJS , and SQL.
 - On the infrastructure side, I work with AWS and Docker, K8s.

 - I've got a few pinned projects here, mostly backend services and APIs.
 - They reflect how I think about system design, code quality, and long-term maintainability.

 - I've worked on many personal and learning projects, and I'm constantly improving my skills through real-world practice.

 - If you want to see how I build things, feel free to check out my projects or reach out to me.

Fun facts:
- I enjoy working on backend problems more than UI
- I like clean code and simple architectures
- I practice data structures & algorithms regularly
- Hobbies: coding, learning new tech, building things
