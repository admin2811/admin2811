Hey there! 👋

I'm Minh, a backend-focused software developer.
I enjoy building reliable systems, designing clean architectures, and turning complex problems into simple, maintainable solutions.

Most of my work revolves around Java and Spring Boot, where I build and improve backend services, design APIs, and think a lot about performance, security, and long-term scalability.
When I'm not coding features, I'm usually refining system design concepts, improving existing codebases, or practicing data structures and algorithms to sharpen my problem-solving skills.

My main tech stack includes Java, SQL, Spring Boot, and Spring Security, with MySQL and PostgreSQL on the data side.
I also work with AWS and Docker to deploy and manage applications in the cloud.
For daily development, I rely on Git, GitHub, IntelliJ IDEA, and VS Code.

I have a few pinned projects here on GitHub that reflect how I approach backend development and code quality.
I'm always interested in learning from real-world systems and improving how things work under the hood.
